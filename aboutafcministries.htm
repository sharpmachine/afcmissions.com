<h2>At the Foot of the Cross Ministries</h2>
 <p class="text">At the foot of the cross ministries is a non-profit ministry based in Phoenix Az. It was founded in 2001 by Anthony Jeffery, who grew up in Sunnyslope (better known in it's day as the point of a triangle for drugs in of all the Phoenix area.) The ministry was established to reach out to those that live in darkness. At the Foot of the Cross Ministry stands firm on the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which was brought to us through the unconditional love of God. We believe very strong on John 3:16: "for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.”</p>
<p class="text">With that we make the great commission found in Matthew 28:18-20, our mission statement:<br />Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 	Therefore go and make disciples of  all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of 	the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</p>
<p class="text">See it is the very Heart of God for none to perish, even the unlovable. We are a ministry that believes very strong in being a light in the darkness, knowing that the pure Love of God will bring transformation to the broken hearted.</p><p class="text">1 Peter 4:8 says: “Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.” With that we choose to be a ministry that expresses the true love of God to everyone we come in contact with, giving us our Ministry Purpose:  We are a ministry that chooses to love all people with no exceptions, giving all that we have, expecting nothing in return, being a portrait of THE HEART OF GOD.</p><p class="text">Funding: Currently At the Foot of the Cross Ministries is solely funded by corporate and individual donations. Tax deductible receipts are issued at the end of the year.</p><a class="text" href="giving.html">Make a donation</a>
