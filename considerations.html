<p class="text">Anthony Jeffery and AFC Ministries desires to partner with churches and ministries based in Thailand and Cambodia. We are committed to relationship and networking. Our heart is to strengthen and support other ministries.</p><br /><br />


<h3>CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<ol>
<li>Anthony Jeffery does not have any set speaking fee but graciously accept whatever amount the Lord lays on your heart.</li>



<li>The host church/ministry is responsible for airfares. At times, depending on the circumstances, Anthony may ask for airfare for two or three, but this would be communicated to you in advance.</li>

	

<li>Anthony will travel by land to the destination if it is 6 or fewer hours from his current location. The host is responsible to pay travel expenses  in advance of event. If Anthony is flying, the host is responsible to arrange and book flights.</li>


	

<li>The host church/ministry is responsible for airport pick-ups and drop-offs and for transporting Anthony back and forth to the sessions.</li>


	

<li>The local church/ministry cares for accommodations and meals for Anthony, either in a hotel or in a host home.</li>


<li>Anthony and AFC  would like to reserve the right to cancel a speaking engagement, with plenty of advance notice, should the Lord direct them to do so. Please understand this would only be in extremely rare circumstances.</li>

<h3>HOST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ARRAINGING AND BOOKING ANTHONY JEFFERY AND AFC MINISTRIES TEAM FLIGHTS</h3>
<p class="text"> Any travel by land 6 hours outside of Anthony's current location will require flight arrangements. Once your date is set it is very important to work closely with the AFC Coordinator to ensure that he will get to and from destinations in a timely manner. Some considerations when booking a flight:</p>

	
<ul>
<li>Time zone Thailand is GMT+7.</li>


	

<li>Travel time to and from the airport.</li>

	

<li>Early a.m. and late evening bookings. The price might be right, but a 7am flight means Anthony is up at 4am after possibly ministering until 11pm the night before. Please show grace in early morning departures and late night arrivals.</li>
</ul>
<div>Before Booking a Flight:</div>
<ul>
	

<li>Book within six weeks or less for the best prices. As a general rule, the further out the more expensive a booking. However, there are times when a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is going on, so investigate all avenues.
</li>


<li>Make sure all information is correct (including spelling of names).</li>



<li>Send your AFC Coordinator the proposed schedule for confirmation.</li>



<li>Ask questions! We want this to be a positive experience for all involved, so feel free to ask questions and we'll do our best to serve you.</li>
</ul>
<div>After Booking a Flight:</div>

	<ul>

<li>Send a copy of the itinerary to the Coordinator.</li>



<li>Start praying in an awesome event! </li>
