<h2>Make a One-Time Donation</h2>
<p class="text">We are so thankful for your giving heart.  When you sow into AFC, you are sowing into the children of Thailand.  The Lord said “Ask for the nations and I will give them.”  The nation of Thailand WILL turn their hearts to God.  But the battle will not be won without a fight.  Thank you for answering the call to arms...we will take this nation, and others.</p>
<p class="text">Funding: Currently At the Foot of the Cross Ministries is solely funded by corporate and individual donations. Tax deductible receipts are issued at the end of the year.</p>
