<h2>How Your Donations Help</h2>
<p class="text">Your donations and monthly partnerships help AFC establish light in the midst of darkness.  We are dedicated to rescuing the children from the sex trade and ending poverty in Thailand.  Here are some of ways your giving helps bring light:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bringing the love and Gospel of Jesus to the child traffickers and abusers.  Your donations help pay for expenses such as Bibles to make this possible.</li>      

<li>Funding start-up micro businesses and training centers.  If we can give the people skills, they will have other options of making money other then selling their children to the traffickers.</li>  

<li>Scholarships for children to get an education.  In Thailand, if you don't have money then your children can't go to school.  We want to see no child left behind without an education.</li>    

<li>Funding to build more children and restoration homes.  Currently there are approximately 400,000 children being trafficked.  Once rescued, these child may not have a home to go back to.  The need for more children and restoration homes is great.</li>   
</ul>
