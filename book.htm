<p  class="text1">This book I began to write at a very special time of my life. A place where I desired more. I not only wanted my Jesus more but needed Him more. I desired more intimacy with my Savior and God. I started this book in 2005 and the journey continued for 5 years. His timing is always perfect. 
<br \>
The completion of this book took place at a very subdued time in my life with Jesus. So much inter healing came as I finished the writing of His living Word in this daily devotion. My heart for you is no matter where you are in life, this book will touch your inter soul and spirit as much as it did mine and what ever the touch is you need from God, it will be accomplished through this read. Be blessed and let the RIVER flow in and through you.<br \>
Blessings!<br \>
Anthony B. Jeffery</p>
