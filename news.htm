<h3>One Year in Jail for Raping a 4-year-old</h3>
<p class="text">This is the case of a man who raped and sodomized a four-year-old child and was sentenced to serve only ONE year in jail.</p>
<p class="text">We need to press in and pray - if this case becomes a precedent, we may see many criminals who are not full prosecuted and then set free. Serving an appropriate sentence is a strong prevention mechanism for people who are struggling with pedophilia. Repeat offenses are almost certain in these cases and we are shocked at the courts that allowed this man to be released after only a year. As this case develops, we will believe for an appeal and a more appropriate sentence for this heinous crime.</p>
