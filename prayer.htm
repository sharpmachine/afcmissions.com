<h2>Prayer Directives</h2>
<p class="text">Your prayers are just as valuable as your donations.  We believe so strongly in the power of prayer and intercession.  A failure in ministry is a failure in prayer.  So please please please, keep us in your hearts and prayers.  Here are some directives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please pray for the case in the "Recent News" section.  Ask God to serve justice and ask for an appropriate sentence for what this man did to the 4-year-old child.</li>
<li>For the safety of all children in this world, especially those that are being exploited and trafficked into the sex trade.</li>
<li>Prayer against child abuse in all areas, and that there would be a supernatural covering over the children of this world, with their mind body and soul.</li>
<li>Prayer for those that are abusing our children.  They are wounded individuals that need the love of God shown to them also.</li>
<li>Pray that through the action of love shown to these individuals, a healing process would take place, ending hate crimes towards the little children.</li>
<li>Safety for the teams that are going in to these areas with the Gospel, that no weapon formed against them shall prosper.</li>
<li>Wisdom on how to minister for each individual that we come across.  Guidance from the Holy Spirit, on what, when and how, in all situations.</li>
<li>That before we even go in to a area, the Holy Spirit would go in before and prepare the field for the harvest.</li>
<li>That the team would never fall into being judgmental but would always have a pure heart, flowing with the true love of God.</li>
<li>That all our needs would be met each month, and then some.  Pray for an abundance. </li>
<li>That God is moving amongst the people and lives are changing.  That more labourers would come forth, hand picked by the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li>And the most important, that God himself would be glorified at all times, in all the areas we serve Him here at this ministry. </li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Thank you so much, you awesome prayer warriors.  This battle will not be won without you and your prayers.</p>
